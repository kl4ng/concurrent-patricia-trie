%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:

\section{Introduction}
A Patricia Trie, also known as a Radix tree, is a unique version of a regular tree. The defining feature of any trie, also known
as a digital tree, is that the position of a node in a tree defines the key for that node. A Patricia trie takes this and optimizes the tree by 
merging any parent node with only one child in order to save space and create a more efficient tree.\cite{Shafiei2013} \par



\section{Related Works}
Lock free concurrent trees and data structures in general have been progressing in the last couple of years. \cite{Brown2014,Brown2013}
Since there are numerous data structures, the work on concurrent data structures has been spread out among them. However, Shafiei wrote
a paper about Non-blocking Patricia tries \cite{Shafiei2013} that is related to our work. However, in their case they simply used a binary version of the tree 


\section{Rust Language}
Describe it here in detail, especially the parts of the std lib that we are using extensively.


\section{Algorithm Description}
Go into detail about what changes (if any) we make from the original pseudocode. Go into detail about what we do new (hopefully able to implement it with >2 children).


\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.


\section{Acknowledgment}
Acknowledge orignial paper author here once he (hopefully) provides source code and any other patricia trie implementations we test against for empirical evaluation.

\appendix
\subsection{Challenges}
Talk about rust-lang and its difficulties, mainly.


\subsection{Completed Tasks}
Decent chunk of original algorithm done.


\subsection{Remaining Tasks}
Optimize code once completed, then attempt to modify algorithm to be extended to >2 children OR use less memory.
Also need to run performance comparisons.
